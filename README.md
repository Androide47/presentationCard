1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
2. Create a new file called `index.js` and copy the code into it.
3. In the terminal, run the following command to initialize a new npm project:
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install react react-dom
   ```
5. Create a new file called `styles.css` in the same directory and add any desired styling for the card.
6. In the terminal, run the following command to start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the rendered React application.
